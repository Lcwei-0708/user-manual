## Quick Setup

### 1. SSL Certificates Setup

To enable SSL (HTTPS), you need to configure SSL settings in your `.env` file and place your SSL certificates.

**Basic setup:**
```env
SSL_ENABLE=true
SSL_CERT_FILE=cert.pem
SSL_KEY_FILE=privkey.pem
```

Place your SSL certificates in the `ssl` directory:
```bash
nginx/ssl/
├── cert.pem
└── privkey.pem
```

### 2. IP Whitelist Setup

Copy the example whitelist configuration:
```bash
cp whitelist.conf.example whitelist.conf
```

Edit the whitelist.conf file to add your allowed IPs:
```bash
# Example whitelist.conf content:
172.16.0.0/24 1;    # Allow specific subnet
172.16.0.1 1;       # Allow specific IP
```
